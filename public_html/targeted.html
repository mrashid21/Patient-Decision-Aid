                <li>Targeted therapy is a treatment given after surgery and chemotherapy, or at the same time as chemotherapy. It helps to lower the risk of the cancer coming back and increase the chance of cure. An example of such therapy is trastuzumab (Herceptin).</li>
                <li>Herceptin is used to treat Her2 positive breast cancer. Her2 or CerbB2 are protein receptors found on breast cancer cells. Extra Her2 receptors stimulate cancer cells to divide and grow.</li>
                <li>Your doctors can check your Her2 receptors after a tissue biopsy or surgery. The results will help your doctor to decide whether you would benefit from targeted therapy. Additional test may be required if your initial test is not conclusive.</li>
                <li>Herceptin is given by a drip into a vein in the hospital outpatient unit. It is usually given every three weeks up to a year.</li>
                <li>Possible side effects of targeted therapy include flu-like symptoms, diarrhoea, headaches, nausea, and heart failure. It is not recommended for women with heart disease or high blood pressure. Please talk to your doctor for further information.</li>
