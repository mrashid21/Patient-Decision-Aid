            <li>Some breast cancers are ‘hormone-sensitive’. Female hormones that are found naturally in women may stimulate cancer growth. Therefore, hormone therapy works by preventing the female hormones from
                stimulating cancer cells to grow.</li>
            <li>After surgery, the cancer is tested for sensitivity to the female hormone estrogen. This helps the doctor to decide whether you will benefit from hormone therapy.</li>
            <li>Sometimes hormone therapy replaces surgery for women who are too ill to undergo surgery</li>
            <li>Side effects include: hot flushes, night sweats, mood swing, weight gain and painful joints. </li>
