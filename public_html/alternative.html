            <p>Some women prefer alternative treatment such as food supplement, herbal 
            medicine or spiritual healing. So far, there is no good scientific evidence to 
            support using alternative treatment to cure breast cancer.               
            </p>
            <p>Modern medicine is based on scientific evidence while alternative treatment is 
            often based on individual practitioners’ experience.               
            </p>
            <p>You may want to ask the following questions before considering alternative treatment:</p>
            <ul >
                
                <li>‘Is the alternative practitioner qualified in treating breast cancer?’</li>
                <li>‘Is there any scientific information based on human beings (not animals)?’</li>
                <li>‘If there are claims that a person is cured, ask whether is it a breast cancer or a benign breast lump?’ </li>
                <li>‘What is the chance of alternative treatment curing breast cancer compared to surgery?’</li>
                   
            </ul>
            <p>
            It is important to know that most breast cancers grow slowly and do not spread immediately. If the breast cancer 
            does not grow or spread within a few months, it does not mean that the alternative treatment is effective.
