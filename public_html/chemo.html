            <li>Chemotherapy is a medicine doctors use to kill cancer cells in the breast cancer and those that might have spread to other parts of the body.</li>
            <li>It is usually given after surgery but before radiotherapy.</li>
            <li>After surgery, a doctor with special training in chemotherapy and radiotherapy (called an oncologist)  will advice you whether you need chemotherapy.</li>
            <li>Chemotherapy is given as outpatient once every three weeks over a period of 4-6 months. It is given through a line that delivers the medicine into the blood.</li>
            <li>Common side effects of chemotherapy include : mouth ulcers, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, tiredness and changes in the messes.</li>
            <li>Each person responds differently to the chemotherapy but most people would need to take leave from work during chemotherapy.</li>
            <li>These symptoms are temporary and can be reduced by medicine.</li>
            <li>Infections and anaemia are more likely to happen after chemotherapy. A blood test is taken before each treatment to check whether you are fit to undergo the next cycle of chemotherapy.</li>
            <li>Chemotherapy may cause early menopause and infertility in some women. This is only temporary and the body will recover fully.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h3>Please talk to your doctor or breast care nurse if you have any concerns about chemotherapy. </h3>
