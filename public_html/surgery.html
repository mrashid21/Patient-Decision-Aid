            <br><h2>There are two types of surgery for early breast cancer:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lumpectomy</li>
                <li>Mastectomy</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For both lumpectomy and mastectomy, an operation to the armpit is done during the surgery to assess whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. Your doctor will discuss this further with you.</h3>
            
            <br><div class="titlebar2">Lumpectomy</div><br>                      
            <p><h4><img src="lumpectomy.png" alt="lump" width="120px" height="auto" align="right"> Some women prefer lumpectomy because it helps to conserve their breast.
            <ul type="square">
                <li>In lumpectomy, only the part of the breast is removed. The surgeon will remove the cancer lump and up 1cm of the surrounding breast tissue.</li>
                <li>Cancer cells may move the lymph nodes in the armpit. If so, they will be removed during the surgery.</li>
                <li>After the surgery, a drain is used to remove any fluid or blood that collect under the wound. The drain consists of a soft plastic tubes connected to a plastic bottle. It will be removed once there is no more fluid or blood.</li>
                <li>Most women can go home within a day or two.</li>
                <li>Occasionally, another surgery may be needed if cancer cells are too close  to the edge of the tissue removed during lumpectomy. This happens In 20 out of 100 people.</li>

                <li>In the mastectomy. The whole breast, including the nipples is removed leaving a flat chest wall with a scar.</li>
                <li>Most women spend 2-3 night in hospital. Like lumpectomy, a drain which consists a soft plastic tube connected to a plastic bottle will be used to remove any fluid or blood under the wound.</li>
                <li>Some women may consider breast cancer reconstruction surgery where a new breast shape is created. Your surgeon can discuss this further with you.</li>

            <p><h4>Complication can happen after mastectomy. This include:
            <ul type="square">
                
                <li>Seromas : Fluid may gather in the wound a few weeks after the surgery. The fluid can be removed easily with a needle and syringe.</li>
            <li>Bleeding : Sometimes blood gather in the wound causing a swelling.</li>
            <li>Wound infection : Infection may occurs at the wound after surgery. This can be treated with antibiotics.</li>
            <li>Lymphoedema : This is a long-term problem where your arm may become swollen and painful after surgery. This is because surgery may damage the lymphatic drainage under your armpit and causes the lymphatic fluid to accumulate in your arm.</li>
